# Rationale:
# I got tired of using virtualenv, rvm, govm, *vm, and all the others. It just
# seemed stupid to me, to have all these tools that did the exact same thing,
# just for different langauges. Things like portage exist and would work, but
# support way more features than is really needed. MVM should function as a
# replacement for all of the *vm type tools, managing multiple versions of
# any number of arbitrary software packages. It may even be suitable for use
# as a lightweight package manager for small systems at some point. Who knows?!
