* Changelog

Note that this is done in ORG format. If you would like to see all the rendered pretty bits,
open it up in Emacs.  The format is pretty simple, and I'm not using any special features. 
More information about syntax can be found here: 
[[http://orgmode.org/worg/dev/org-syntax.html]Org mode syntax].

I'm changing the format of this to just represent a planned feature list, with no version
roadmap. I'll cut a 1.0.0 version when this list is completed.
