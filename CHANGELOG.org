* Changelog

Note that this is done in ORG format. If you would like to see all the rendered pretty bits,
open it up in Emacs. Which with spacemacs is a pretty slick little setup. In my, at times, humble
opinion. The format is pretty simple, and I'm not using any special features. More information
about syntax can be found here: [[http://orgmode.org/worg/dev/org-syntax.html]Org mode syntax].
