* About MVM
MVM (Myriad Version Manager) is a package meant to do the core job of packages like virtualenv, rvm, multipy and others.
Namely managing multiple versions of a package. The drawback that I felt existed with other projects in this space is that
they focus on managing multiple versions of a single package. MVM concerns it'self with being generic enough to handle
multiple versions of any package.
